Title: Bayesian Adaptive Seasonality Trend Decomposition incorporating
    Outliers and Noise

Description: We introduce BASTION (Bayesian Adaptive Seasonality and Trend
    Decomposition Incorporating Outliers and Noise), a flexible Bayesian
    framework for decomposing time series into trend and multiple
    seasonality components. BASTION offers three key advantages over
    existing decomposition methods: (1) locally adaptive estimation of
    trend and seasonality for enhanced accuracy, (2) explicit modeling of
    outliers and time-varying volatility for greater robustness, and (3)
    rigorous uncertainty quantification through credible intervals.
