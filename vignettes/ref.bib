@article{dsp,
	abstract = {{We propose a novel class of dynamic shrinkage processes for Bayesian time series and regression analysis. Building on a global--local framework of prior construction, in which continuous scale mixtures of Gaussian distributions are employed for both desirable shrinkage properties and computational tractability, we model dependence between the local scale parameters. The resulting processes inherit the desirable shrinkage behaviour of popular global--local priors, such as the horseshoe prior, but provide additional localized adaptivity, which is important for modelling time series data or regression functions with local features. We construct a computationally efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm based on a P{\'o}lya--gamma scale mixture representation of the process proposed. Using dynamic shrinkage processes, we develop a Bayesian trend filtering model that produces more accurate estimates and tighter posterior credible intervals than do competing methods, and we apply the model for irregular curve fitting of minute-by-minute Twitter central processor unit usage data. In addition, we develop an adaptive time varying parameter regression model to assess the efficacy of the Fama--French five-factor asset pricing model with momentum added as a sixth factor. Our dynamic analysis of manufacturing and healthcare industry data shows that, with the exception of the market risk, no other risk factors are significant except for brief periods.}},

@article{kimetal,
	abstract = {In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods are exploited to provide a unified, practical likelihood-based framework for the analysis of stochastic volatility models. A highly effective method is developed that samples all the unobserved volatilities at once using an approximating offset mixture model, followed by an importance reweighting procedure. This approach is compared with several alternative methods using real data. The paper also develops simulation-based methods for filtering, likelihood evaluation and model failure diagnostics. The issue of model choice using non-nested likelihood ratios and Bayes factors is also investigated. These methods are used to compare the fit of stochastic volatility and GARCH models. All the procedures are illustrated in detail.},

In particular, it is shown that the class of self-reciprocal normal variance mixtures is rather wide, and some Tauberian results are established from which relations between the tail behaviour of a normal variance-mean mixture and its mixing distribution may be deduced. The generalized hyperbolic distributions and the modulated normal distributions provide examples of normal variance-mean mixtures whose densities can be given in terms of well-known functions, and it is proved that also the z distributions, i.e. the class of distributions generated from the beta distribution through logistic transformation followed by introduction of location and scale parameters, are normal variance-mean mixtures.

Some properties of the associated mixing distributions are derived, and the z distributions are shown to be self-decomposable. /// Nous presentons une vue d'ensemble des propri{\'e}tes des lois probabilit{\'e}s qui sont mixtures 'variance-moyen' des distributions normale.

@article{omorietal,
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility (SV) models with leverage. Specifically, the paper shows how the often used Kim et al. [1998. Stochastic volatility: likelihood inference and comparison with ARCH models. Review of Economic Studies 65, 361--393] method that was developed for SV models without leverage can be extended to models with leverage. The approach relies on the novel idea of approximating the joint distribution of the outcome and volatility innovations by a suitably constructed ten-component mixture of bivariate normal distributions. The resulting posterior distribution is summarized by MCMC methods and the small approximation error in working with the mixture approximation is corrected by a reweighting procedure. The overall procedure is fast and highly efficient. We illustrate the ideas on daily returns of the Tokyo Stock Price Index. Finally, extensions of the method are described for superposition models (where the log-volatility is made up of a linear combination of heterogenous and independent autoregressions) and heavy-tailed error distributions (student and log-normal).},

This is often achieved by employing suitable shrinkage priors that penalize model complexity but also reward model fit. In this article, we modify the stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) model by introducing state-of-the-art shrinkage techniques that allow for time variation in the degree of shrinkage. Using a real-time inflation forecast exercise, we show that employing more flexible prior distributions on several key parameters sometimes improves forecast performance for the United States, the United Kingdom, and the euro area (EA). Comparing in-sample results reveals that our proposed model yields qualitatively similar insights to the original version of the model.},

abstract = { We propose a new method for decomposing seasonal data: a seasonal-trend decomposition using regression (STR). Unlike other decomposition methods, STR allows for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, covariates, seasonal patterns that may have noninteger periods, and seasonality with complex topology. It can be used for time series with any regular time index, including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly data. It is competitive with existing methods when they exist and tackles many more decomposition problems than other methods allow. STR is based on a regularized optimization and so is somewhat related to ridge regression. Because it is based on a statistical model, we can easily compute confidence intervals for components, something that is not possible with most existing decomposition methods (such as seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess, X-12-ARIMA, SEATS-TRAMO, etc.). Our model is implemented in the R package stR, so it can be applied by anyone to their own data. }

abstract = {In this paper, we study how to capture explicit periodicity to boost the accuracy of deep models in univariate time series forecasting. Recent advanced deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers have reached new heights in terms of modeling sequential data, such as natural languages, due to their powerful expressiveness. However, real-world time series are often more periodic than general sequential data, while recent studies confirm that standard neural networks are not capable of capturing the periodicity sufficiently because they have no modules that can represent periodicity explicitly. In this paper, we alleviate this challenge by bridging the self-attention network with time series decomposition and propose a novel framework called DeepFS. DeepFS equips <u> Deep </u> models with <u> F </u> ourier <u> S </u>eries to preserve the periodicity of time series. Specifically, our model first uses self-attention to encode temporal patterns, from which to predict the periodic and non-periodic components for reconstructing the forecast outputs. The Fourier series is injected as an inductive bias in the periodic component. Capturing periodicity not only boosts the forecasting accuracy but also offers interpretable insights for real-world time series. Extensive empirical analyses on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepFS. Studies about why and when DeepFS works provide further understanding of our model.},

abstract = {Summary The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of different methods of forecasting malaria incidence from historical morbidity patterns in areas with unstable transmission. We tested five methods using incidence data reported from health facilities in 20 areas in central and north-western Ethiopia. The accuracy of each method was determined by calculating errors resulting from the difference between observed incidence and corresponding forecasts obtained for prediction intervals of up to 12 months. Simple seasonal adjustment methods outperformed a statistically more advanced autoregressive integrated moving average method. In particular, a seasonal adjustment method that uses mean deviation of the last three observations from expected seasonal values consistently produced the best forecasts. Using 3 years' observation to generate forecasts with this method gave lower errors than shorter or longer periods. Incidence during the rainy months of June–August was the most predictable with this method. Forecasts for the normally dry months, particularly December–February, were less accurate. The study shows the limitations of forecasting incidence from historical morbidity patterns alone, and indicates the need for improved epidemic early warning by incorporating external predictors such as meteorological factors.},

abstract = {A study of business cycles does not require trend estimation and elimination, but a study of growth cycles does. Major cyclical slowdowns and speedups deserve to be analyzed, but the needed time series decomposition presents difficult problems, mainly because trends and cycles influence each other. We compare cyclical movements in levels, deviations from trend, and smoothed growth rates for both the quarterly real GDP and the monthly U.S. Coincident Index—using the phase average trend (PAT). Then we compare alternative trend estimates, deterministic and stochastic, linear and nonlinear, and the corresponding series of deviations from these trends. We discuss how the resulting estimates differ for U.S. growth cycles in the post-World War II period. The results of PAT show great similarity to the results obtained with the Hodrick–Prescott, local linear trend, band-pass filtering methods.}

For laws containing a location and a scale parameter a form with a somewhat restricted type of invariance is found even when the law is not everywhere differentiable with regard to the parameters. This form has the properties required to give a general rule for stating the prior probability in a large class of estimation problems. }

@article{ARCH,
	abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

This does not mean that oil shocks caused these recessions. Evidence is presented, however, that even over the period 1948-72 this correlation is statistically significant and nonspurious, supporting the proposition that oil shocks were a contributing factor in at least some of the U.S. recessions prior to 1972. By extension, energy price increases may account for much of post-OPEC macroeconomic performance.},

It utilizes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers to conduct inference by obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of parameters and latent variables which can then be used for predicting future volatilities. The package can straightforwardly be employed as a stand-alone tool; moreover, it allows for easy incorporation into other MCMC samplers. The main focus of this paper is to show the functionality of stochvol. In addition, it provides a brief mathematical description of the model, an overview of the sampling schemes used, and several illustrative examples using exchange rate data.},
